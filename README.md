# Job - Resume Matcher

The idea of this project is to match relevant jobs with candidate's resume, and relevant candidates with individual job given the job description.

The project is divided into:
1. Parser (Resume and Job description parser)
2. Updating tha database for both resume and job descriptions.
3. Create an algorithm to give relevant scores considering multiple factors like job_tilte, skills, work_experience, location, domain, etc.
4. Finally a matcher which will match with top job and resumes based on scores generated by our algorithm.


For the frontend, I have used Streamlit. This is where an user can either upload their resume files in pdf format to get top matching job profiles or recruiter can paste their job description to get the top resumes.

For the api for parsing, updating database and scoring, I have used FastAPI along with uvicorn.

For storing the data - both resumes and job descriptions, I am using mongoDB, different collections for each.

For containerization, I have used Docker.
